# Best Practices for Sharing Your Work
A variety of academic and research products have value and can be shared.  In this lesson we'll identify some of these products, discuss tools and best practices for sharing them, and then create a new page in your website for doing so.
## The Variety of Useful Outputs That Can be Shared
![outputs](../images/outputs.png)

There is growing recognition of the value of sharing different kinds of scholarly products, especially those underlying scientific papers, such as datasets and code.  The scope of valuable products includes outputs that are often used to communicate early results, such as posters and conference presentations, and project workflows, such as tested protocols.  

Also, think beyond your research projects!  You've likely authored or contributed to other kinds of highly valuable and resuable work and scholarly products, such as instructional plans and materials, white papers, and advocacy resources.
## Benefits of Sharing 
Sharing your work in ways that facilitate discovery and attribution (which we'll get to next!) can lead to many benefits:

- Transparency & reproducibility
- Early credit and feedback
- Policy compliance
- Deeper enagement with your work

These outcomes are important to researchers and educators across career stages, but we want to take a moment to highlight the advantages for students and early career individuals.  Learning and applying these practices contributes to the integrity of your work and you'll gain experience with techniques and tools that funders, journals, and institutions are increasingly promoting and even requiring.  Moreover, you can share work and describe your contributions sooner and more completely than what is supported by the typical journal article publication process.  
## Best Practices and Platforms
## Adding Pages and Site Menu

If you take a look at this [example site](https://laderast.github.io/), you'll notice a menu bar at the top with links to pages for the contributions Ted wants to showcase.  Your site doesn't yet include a menu or additional pages, but you can easily add both.

First, let's take a look at the files we'll be working with in the main directory of your website repository.  Pages are generated from files that end in `.md`(except `LICENSE.md` and `README.md`).  Your site menu is created from the `_data/navigation.yml`.  You'll probably notice that there are some `.md` files in your repository that don't yet appear on your site, such as `presentations.md`.  These are templated pages that you can update and add to your site menu, but you can also create new pages.

To create a new static page that shows up in your menu bar, you need to include the following elements at the top of your .md file.  In the example below, I've titled my new page `Coursework`, but you can use a title of your choice.  

```
---
layout: page
title: Coursework
---

Text for your page goes here.
```

Try adding a new `.md` file in the main director of your respository by pasting the text above and then writing some content. You can add some bullets by using the + symbol like this:

```
+ Data Visualization
+ Statistics
+ GitHub Class
```

Which will show up like this:

+ Basket Weaving
+ Cooking
+ GitHub Class

Then you'll have to edit the `_data/navigation.yml` file to add that menu item. Here's my `navigation.yml` file:

```
# Site navigation links
- title: Home
  url: /

- title: Presentations
  url: /presentations/

- title: CV
  url: /cv/

- title: Blog
  url: /blog/

- title: Workshops
  url: /workshops/
```
Add another `title`/`url` entry for coursework. We named our file `coursework.md`, so the `url` will be `/coursework/`. Make sure that you start out with `-`.

When you're done, commit and load your website again. Confirm that "Coursework" shows up in the menubar. Neat!

If you don't want your blog to show up, you can delete its `title`/`url` entry here.
