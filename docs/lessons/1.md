# A Personal Website for Professional Outreach
A personal website can serve as a flexible hub for describing your interests and expertise, and sharing your scholarly contributions, including articles, code, posters and instructional materials.  This workshop will walk you through the technical steps for creating a website with Github Pages and some strategies for using it effectively for professional outreach and disseminating your work.

## The Benefits of Having a Website

A personal website takes time to build and maintain, so why do it?

- Depending on where you are in your career and your social media activity, you might have several online profiles, such as on Twitter, an institutional staff or student page, ORCID and LinkedIn.  A personal website can serve as a hub that links out to and contextualizes these profiles and activities.
- It can be customized to help you achieve and reflect your current goals and interests.  
- Stays with you, regardless of where you go professionally.
- Allows you to showcase and provide access to contributions and research outputs beyond peer reviewed articles.

## What is Github Pages?
GitHub Pages is a system built into GitHub that allows you to build websites directly from a GitHub Repository.

There are three kinds of GitHub Pages websites:

- User websites (associated with a personal Github account)
- Organizational websites (associated with an organizational Github account)
- Project websites (associated with a specific project hosted on Github)

This workshop focuses on user websites.  We'll cover this in detail in the next lesson, but it is important to note that GitHub Pages user websites must be built from a repository owned by your account and named as so:  <*Github username*>.github.io.  For example, my Github username is rchampieux and the repository that builds my user website is named rchampieux.github.io.

## Why GitHub Pages?
GitHub is a highly dependable webhost, and you get one personal webpage account for free.  Plus, if you move institutions, your website can travel with you.

Because GitHub pages is compatible with Markdown, we'll be using Markdown formatting to build our webpage.

## What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is what's known as a static site generator. It will build a website from simple text files that are in Markdown.  Markdown is much easier to work with, since you don't have to worry about adding HTML tags and accidentally breaking it.

The other nice thing about Jekyll is that it will integrate things like Google Analytics, tags, and search into your website structure.

Jekyll is built into GitHub, so you just need to edit the files in your repository to have GitHub automatically build the webpage.
