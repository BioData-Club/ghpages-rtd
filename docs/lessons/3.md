# The Magic of Markdown

![Markdown Logo](images/markdown.png)

> Markdown is a light-weight markup language that uses a simple, unobtrusive syntax to add formatting, such as headings and italics, to plain text documents.  It can be easily converted to many output formats, most notably HTML.  

## Why is Markdown Magic?

- It makes writing for the web easy and fun!  There are many free applications that create website content from markdown files, like Read the Docs.
- Unlike HTML, it's easy to read even when you're looking at a raw file.
- There's a gentle learning curve and lots of [online documentation](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- Many use cases:  websites, [documents](https://ulysses.app/), [slides](https://github.com/gnab/remark), [books](https://leanpub.com), and more!

## The Basics

You can create Markdown files using a text editor.  The file should have a `.md` or `.markdown` extension.  You can also use a dedicated Markdown application, like [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/).

### Brief Syntax Primer

To create headings, add hash signs (e.g. # The Magic of Markdown) in front of a word or phrase.  Use 1 hash sign `#` for level 1 headings, use 2 hash signs `##` for level two headings, and so on.

```
The header for this section is written like this in Markdown:
### Brief Syntax Primer
```

To bold text use two asterisks before and after a word or phrase.  

```
**bold**
will render as:
```

**bold**

For italic use one asterisk before and after a word or phrase.

```
*italics*
will render as:
```

*italics*

Unordered lists are can be created with asterisks `*`, pluses `+`, or minuses `-`.

```
* October
* November
* December
```

will render as:

* October
* November
* December

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets `[this guide]` and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses `(https://www.markdownguide.org/)`.  

```
Content from [this guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
was adapted for this lesson
will render as:
```

Use one back tick around code to create in-line code blocks and three back ticks to create multi-line fenced off blocks.

```
This line has some `code` in it
will render as:
```

This line has some `code` in it.
