# The Magic of Markdown

![Markdown Logo](images/markdown.png)

Markdown is a light-weight markup language that uses an unobtrusive syntax to add formatting, such as headings and italics, to plain text documents.  It can be easily converted to many output formats, most notably HTML.

## Why is Markdown Magic?

- It makes writing for the web easy and fun!  There are many free applications that create website content from markdown files.
- Unlike HTML, it's easy to read even when you're looking at a raw file.
- There's a gentle learning curve and lots of online documentation [**like this widely used Markdown cheatsheet**](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
- There are many use cases like:
  - Websites
  - [Documents](https://ulysses.app/)
  - [Slides](https://github.com/gnab/remark)
  - [Books](https://leanpub.com)

## The Essentials

You can create Markdown files using a text editor.  The file should have a `.md` or `.markdown` extension.  You can also use a dedicated Markdown application, like [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) for immediately live and published content.

### Brief Syntax Primer

To create headings, add hash signs (e.g. `# The Magic of Markdown`) in front of a word or phrase.  Use 1 `#` for level 1 headings, use 2 `##` for level two headings, and so on.

The header for this section is written like this in Markdown:

```markdown
### Brief Syntax Primer
```

To bold text use two asterisks before and after a word or phrase.  

```markdown
**bold**
```

will render as:

**bold**

For italic use one asterisk before and after a word or phrase.

```markdown
*italics*
```

will render as:

*italics*

Unordered lists are can be created with asterisk `*`, plus sign `+`, or hyphen `-`.

```markdown
- October
- November
- December
```

will render as:

- October
- November
- December

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets `[this guide]` and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses `(https://www.markdownguide.org/)`.  

```markdown
Content from [this guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) was adapted for this lesson.
```

will render as:

Content from [this guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) was adapted for this lesson.

Use one back tick around code to create in-line monospace code and three back ticks to create multi-line fenced off code blocks.

```markdown
This line has some `code` in it.
```

will render as:

This line has some `code` in it.

## Hands-on: HackMD
