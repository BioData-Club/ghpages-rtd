You might not like the layout of your page (that's fine). You can transfer your markdown files into a different Jekyll Theme and use that as the basis for your website.

Many of these themes you can fork and make a website directly, much like this tutorial. Note that you'll have to copy over any files that you've changed (such as the `cv.md` files and your blog posts in the `_posts` folder) to get them to show up in your new theme.

Unfortunately, the themes are not like plugins. Which means you will have to cut and paste your content into the new forked repo. The GitHub Pages developers are trying to make this process more streamlined. The big issue is that the `_config.yml` files have different fields and options depending on the template.
