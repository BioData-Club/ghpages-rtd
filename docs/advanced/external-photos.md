## Let's Add an Image (from an external website)

You can also add images to your webpage. GitHub has a mascot called Octocat, so let's add a picture of Octocat to our site. Doing this is very similar to adding a link, you just need to add an exclamation mark in front of the square bracket and parentheses. Try adding a picture to your `cv.md` file!

An example looks like this

```
![Jetpacktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/jetpacktocat.png)
```
The output looks like this:

![Jetpacktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/jetpacktocat.png)

**Note**: The text within the square brackets should be a description of the image.  Providing this is good practice, and facilitates compliance with accessibility technologies (such as screen readers), but you can leave it blank and the following would also work.

```
![](https://octodex.github.com/images/jetpacktocat.png)
```
