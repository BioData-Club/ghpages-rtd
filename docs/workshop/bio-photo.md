Where do you put images you've made?  In the `images/` folder.  Upload a headshot or other representative photo to this folder that is already exactly named as `bio-photo.jpg` (Click the **Upload Files** button).

If you upload other images into to that directory you can refer to them inside your website Markdown files like this:

```
![Bio Photo](images/bio-photo.jpg)
```

Now check out your website again.  The picture you uploaded should have replaced the generic image we started with.
