## To start

With GitHub, you can create a personal website using GitHub Pages.  Bring a laptop to the workshop.  All you need to start is [a GitHub account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home).

Welcome to the BioData Club GitHub Pages Tutorial!

## What you need for the workshop

You don't need to know how to code or know HTML to setup a GitHub Page.  It would be helpful, but not necessary, to have the following on hand to add some first website content:

- A short bio
- A headshot (or another image that represents your professional interests)

The workshop starts with first steps [on the next page here](../first-steps).

During the workshop, be sure to use your sticky notes as a flag if you're stuck and one of the facilitators will help you.

## Goal for the workshop

We're going to build a personal webpage which will live at USERNAME.github.io.  

There is a live example of the template here: [https://biodata-club.github.io/jekyll-academic/](https://biodata-club.github.io/jekyll-academic/).

## What is GitHub Pages?

GitHub Pages is a system built into GitHub that allows you to build websites directly from a GitHub Repository.

There are two kinds of GitHub Pages:

- Personal websites (associated with an account)
- Repository Specific Websites (webpages for software or projects)

We will cover the personal website for today.

## Why GitHub Pages?

GitHub is a highly dependable webhost, and you get one personal webpage account for free.  Plus, if you move institutions, your website can travel with you.

Because GitHub pages is compatible with Markdown, we'll be using Markdown formatting to build our webpage.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is what's known as a static site generator. It will build a website from simple text files that are in Markdown.  Markdown is much easier to work with, since you don't have to worry about adding HTML tags and accidentally breaking it.

The other nice thing about Jekyll is that it will integrate things like Google Analytics, tags, and search into your website structure.

Jekyll is built into GitHub, so you just need to edit the files in your repository to have GitHub automatically build the webpage.
