Your `index.md` file controls your website's front page.  You'll want to update it with your short bio and links to relevant projects and interests.  For example, take a look at [Robin's GitHub Page](https://rchampieux.github.io/) or [Eric's GitHub Page](https://ericearl.github.io/).

Robin's bio and project list links out to other websites.  It's easy to do this in markdown.  Add a link by enclosing the text for your link in square brackets (`[text here]`) and the underlying link in parentheses (`(http://link-here.com)`) right next to it (no spaces). So altogether, it looks like this:

```
[link to Google](https://www.google.com)
```

Try updating your bio and adding some links to your `index.md` file, such as a recently published paper or public projects.  Click the **Commit changes** button when you're done.
