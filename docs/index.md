BioData Club is an informal community at OHSU dedicated to promoting a fun and supportive culture of interdisciplinary co-learning in data science skills and open science principles. We host workshops, along with social events where you can work on personal projects among friends. We welcome everyone at all skill levels who aim to better their skills in all things data. We want to replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn and share.
