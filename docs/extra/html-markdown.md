Another cool thing about markdown is that you can add HTML directly into markdown files and the HTML should integrate pretty seamlessly. This is great when you want to customize placement of things.

For example, maybe we want a smaller version of octocat. We can just add an `<img>` tag to customize it, and change the `height` attribute.

```
<img src="https://octodex.github.com/images/jetpacktocat.png"
height="300">
```
<img src="https://octodex.github.com/images/jetpacktocat.png" height="300">
